## Neural Network Model for Credit Card Fraud Forecasting

### Introduction

This project aims to develop a Neural Network Model for Credit Card Fraud Forecasting,, leveraging deep learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The projectâ€™s ultimate goal is to improve fraud detection efficiency , reducing financial losses

### Data

The dataset used in this analysis contains credit card transactions in September 2013 by European cardholders. These transactions occured in two days, including 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The explanatory variables are `V1,..., V28`, `Time`, and `Amount`. The outcome variable is `Class`. The dataset can be viewed and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download).

|Variable|Explanatory|
|---|---|
|`V1,...,V28`|principle components obtained with PCA|
|`Time`|seconds elapsed between the first and each following transaction|
|`Amount`|transaction amount|
|`Class` (response)|1: fraud, 0: otherwise|
