## Neural Network Model for Credit Card Fraud Forecasting

### Introduction

### Data

The dataset used in this analysis contains credit card transactions in September 2013 by European cardholders. These transactions occured in two days, including 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The explanatory variables are `V1,..., V28`, `Time`, and `Amount`. The dataset can be viewed and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download).

|Variable|Explanatory|
|---|---|
|`V1,...,V28`|principle components obtained with PCA|
|`Time`|seconds elapsed between the first and each following transaction|
|`Amount`|transaction amount|
